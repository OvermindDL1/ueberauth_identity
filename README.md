# ÃœberauthIdentity

Implements a simple strategy for Ueberauth useful for username/password
strategies.

Add to the config

````elixir

config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  providers: [
    identity: { Uerberauth.Strategy.Identity, [] }
  ]

# in your pipeline
Ueberauth.plug "/auth"
````

This will setup the request and callback phases at `/auth/identity` and
`/auth/identity/callback`.

You can modify the fields used to complete the `Ueberauth.Auth` struct by
passing options in your configuration.

````elixir
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  providers: [
    identity: { Uerberauth.Strategy.Identity, [uid_field: :username, nickname_field: :username] }
  ]
````

You can change the http method for the callback with the `:methods` option

````elixir
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  providers: [
    identity: { Uerberauth.Strategy.Identity, [methods: ["POST"]] }
  ]
````

Inside your request phase handler `/auth/identity` you should implement a form
or something similar to collect the required information.

Then in your callback you will have access to the `Ueberauth.Auth` struct

````elixir
get "/auth/identity/callback" do
  auth = conn.assigns.ueberauth_auth
  # lookup or create your user
  # |> Guardian.Plug.sign_in(user, :browser)
end
````

## Installation

  1. Add ueberauth_identity to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

````elixir
def deps do
  [{:ueberauth_identity, "~> 0.0.1"}]
end
